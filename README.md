To install with Zef:

	zef install Imlib2


Synopsis
--------
WARNING: This module is Work in Progress, which means: this interface is not final. This will perhaps change in the future.

Below is a sample code:

```Perl6
use Imlib2;

my $im = Imlib2.new();
# Create a new raw image.
my $rawimage = $im.create_image(200, 200);
exit() unless $rawimage;

# Sets the current image Imlib2 will be using with its function calls.
$rawimage.context_set();
 
# Sets the color with which text, lines and rectangles are drawn when
# being rendered onto an image.
$im.context_set_color(
	red   => 255,
	green => 127,
	blue  => 0,
	alpha => 255);
 
$im.image_draw_rectangle(
	location => (0, 0),
	size     => (200, 200),
	fill     => True);
$im.image_set_format("png");
unlink("images/test_imlib2.png") if "images/test_imlib2.png".IO ~~ :e;
$im.save_image("images/test_imlib2.png");

# Frees the image that is set as the current image in Imlib2's context. 
$im.free_image();

exit();
```
